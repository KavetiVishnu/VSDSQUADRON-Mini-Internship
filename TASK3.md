# RISC-V Architecture   
 * RISC-V is an open-standard, Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architecture designed for simplicity, modularity, and scalability.        
 * It provides a streamlined and extensible instruction set, making it highly efficient for a wide range of applications, from embedded systems to high-performance computing.     
 * Its load-store architecture, optimized instruction set, and support for various extensions (e.g., integer, floating-point, vector processing) make it a powerful choice for diverse computing needs.   
## RISC-V Instruction Formats  
1. R-Type – Register-Register operations   
2. I-Type – Immediate operations  
3. S-Type – Store operations  
4. B-Type – Branch operations  
5. U-Type – Upper Immediate operations  
6. J-Type – Jump operations
