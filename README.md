# VSDSQUADRON-Mini-Internship
The **VSDSquadron Research Internship 2025** focuses on RISC-V architecture and open-source tools for VLSI chip design. Under the mentorship of **Mr. Kunal Ghosh**, I am gaining hands-on experience in designing RISC-V-based systems while working with industry-standard open-source methodologies.

Set up Ubuntu on VirtualBox and install the RISC-V GNU Toolchain, GTKWave, Yosys, and Icarus Verilog (Iverilog) to support development tasks for this internship.
