##RISC-V GNU Toolchain : 

Definition: The RISC-V GNU Toolchain is a suite of development tools, including GCC, Binutils, GDB, and Newlib, used for compiling, debugging, and building software for RISC-V architectures.
Significance: This toolchain is crucial for writing, compiling, and debugging code on RISC-V-based systems, enabling efficient embedded development, performance optimization, and low-level programming.



Yosys :

Definition: Yosys is an open-source logic synthesis tool used for RTL (Register Transfer Level) design, primarily targeting FPGA and ASIC development. It supports Verilog and enables optimization, verification, and conversion of hardware designs.
Significance: In my internship, Yosys plays a key role in synthesizing and optimizing hardware designs, allowing me to work on FPGA-based projects, verify digital circuits, and improve design efficiency.
